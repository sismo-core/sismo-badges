This repository contains the smart contracts of the Sismo Protocol.

There are three core contracts:

 - `core/AttestationsRegistry.sol`: The registry stores all attestations. It is owned by the governance that authorize/unauthorize issuers to record in it
 - `core/Attester.sol` The standard abstract contract must be inherited by attesters. Attesters are issuers of attestations. They verify user requests and build attestations that will be recorded in the registry
 - `core/Badges.sol` Reads the registry. Stateless Non Transferable Token view of attestations (ERC1155)

It also contains implementations of attester in `attesters/`:
- `HydraS1SimpleAttester.sol`: ZK Attester using the [Hydra S1 Proving Scheme](https://hydra-s1.docs.sismo.io) and the notion of tickets (nullifiers). Users must provide a ZK Proof along their request to generate attestations
- `HydraS1AccountboundAttester.sol`: Accountbound version of the Simple Hydra S1 Simple Attester. (Users can update at will where the attestation is stored)

## Create a new Attester

To develop a new attester, you must inherit the `core/Attester.sol` abstract contract and implement the following functions: 

-  `_verifyRequest(request, proofData)`: You must implement the user request verification against the proof provided by the user
-  `buildAttestations(request, proofData)`: You must build the attestations that will be recorded from a verified user request

There are other optional hook functions that can be implemented:

- `_beforeRecordAttestations(request, proofData)`
- `_afterRecordAttestations(request, proofData)`

The `/attesters/hydra-s1/HydraS1SimpleAttester.sol` is a good example of an attester implementing those functions.

A [guide](https://attesters.docs.sismo.io) is offered in our documentation.

Feel free open a PR with your new attester in `/attester`!
