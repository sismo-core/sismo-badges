Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\\n *\\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\\n * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\\n * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\\n *\\n * For example:\\n *\\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\\n * ```\\n * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\\n *     function initialize() initializer public {\\n *         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");\\n *     }\\n * }\\n * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\\n *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\\n *         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");\\n *     }\\n * }\\n * ```\\n *\\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\\n *\\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\\n *\\n * [CAUTION]\\n * ====\\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\\n *\\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\\n * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke\\n * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:\\n *\\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\\n * ```\\n * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\\n * constructor() {\\n *     _disableInitializers();\\n * }\\n * ```\\n * ====\\n */\\nabstract contract Initializable {\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Indicates that the contract has been initialized.\\n     * @custom:oz-retyped-from bool\\n     */\\n    uint8 private _initialized;\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Indicates that the contract is in the process of being initialized.\\n     */\\n    bool private _initializing;\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Triggered when the contract has been initialized or reinitialized.\\n     */\\n    event Initialized(uint8 version);\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev A modifier that defines a protected initializer function that can be invoked at most once.

attesters enable users to prove they have an account in a group in a privacy preserving way.\\n * The Hydra-S1 Simple Attester contract is inherited and holds the complex Hydra S1 verification logic.\\n * Request verification alongside proof verification is already implemented in the inherited HydraS1SimpleAttester, along with the buildAttestations logic.\\n * However, we override the buildAttestations function to encode the nullifier and its burn count in the user attestation.\\n * The _beforeRecordAttestations is also overriden to fit the Accountbound logic.\\n * We invite readers to refer to:\\n *    - https://hydra-s1.docs.sismo.io for a full guide through the Hydra-S1 ZK Attestations\\n *    - https://hydra-s1-circuits.docs.sismo.io for circuits, prover and verifiers of Hydra-S1\\n\\n * This specific attester has the following characteristics:\\n\\n * - Zero Knowledge\\n *   One cannot deduct from an attestation what source account was used to generate the underlying proof\\n\\n * - Non Strict (scores)\\n *   If a user can generate an attestation of max value 100, they can also generate any attestation with value < 100.\\n *   This attester generate attestations of scores\\n\\n * - Nullified\\n *   Each source account gets one nullifier per claim (i.e only one attestation per source account per claim)\\n *   While semaphore/ tornado cash are using the following notations: nullifierHash = hash(IdNullifier, externalNullifier)\\n *   We prefered to use the naming 'nullifier' instead of 'nullifierHash' in our contracts and documentation.\\n *   We also renamed 'IdNullifier' in 'sourceSecret' (the secret tied to a source account) and we kept the 'externalNullifier' notation.\\n *   Finally, here is our notations at Sismo: nullifier = hash(sourceSecret, externalNullifier)\\n\\n * - Accountbound (opt-in, with cooldown period)\\n *   The owner of this attester can set a cooldown duration for a specific group, activating the accountbound feature for this group.\\n *   Users can update their attestation's destination by providing a new Hydra-S1 ZK proof \\n *   It means the attestation is bound to the source account, stored on an updatable destination account.\\n *   When deleting/ sending to a new destination, the nullifier will enter a cooldown period, so it remains occasional.\\n *   A group that has its cooldown duration set to 0 means it has been configured to not feature accountbound attestations, attestations can not be transferred\\n *   One can however know that the former and the new destinations were created using the same nullifier, thus creating a link between those two destinations.\\n \\n * - Renewable\\n *   A nullifier can actually be reused as long as the destination of the attestation remains the same\\n *   It enables users to renew or update their attestations\\n **/\\n\\ncontract HydraS1AccountboundAttester is\\n  IHydraS1AccountboundAttester,\\n

of Hydra-S1\\n\\n * This specific attester has the following characteristics:\\n\\n * - Zero Knowledge\\n *   One cannot deduct from an attestation what source account was used to generate the underlying proof\\n\\n * - Non Strict (scores)\\n *   If a user can generate an attestation of max value 100, they can also generate any attestation with value < 100.\\n *   This attester generate attestations of scores\\n\\n * - Nullified\\n *   Each source account gets one nullifier per claim (i.e only one attestation per source account per claim)\\n *   For people used to semaphore/ tornado cash people:\\n *   nullifier = hash(sourceSecret, externalNullifier) <=> nullifierHash = hash(IdNullifier, externalNullifier)\\n \\n * - Renewable\\n *   A nullifier can actually be reused as long as the destination of the attestation remains the same\\n *   It enables users to renew their attestations\\n **/\\n\\ncontract HydraS1SimpleAttester is IHydraS1SimpleAttester, HydraS1Base {\\n  using
