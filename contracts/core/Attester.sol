/**
 * @title Attester Abstract Contract
 * @author Sismo
 * @notice Contract to be inherited by Attesters
 * All attesters that expect to be authorized in Sismo Protocol (i.e write access on the registry)
 * are recommended to implemented this abstract contract

 * Take a look at the HydraS1SimpleAttester.sol for example on how to implement this abstract contract
 *
 * This contracts is built around two main external standard functions.
 * They must NOT be override them, unless your really know what you are doing
 
 * - generateAttestations(request, proof) => will write attestations in the registry
 * 1. (MANDATORY) Implement the buildAttestations() view function which generate attestations from user request
 * 2. (MANDATORY) Implement teh _verifyRequest() internal function where to write checks
 * 3. (OPTIONAL)  Override _beforeRecordAttestations and _afterRecordAttestations hooks

 * - deleteAttestations(collectionId, owner, proof) => will delete attestations in the registry
 * 1. (DEFAULT)  By default this function throws (see _verifyAttestationsDeletionRequest)
 * 2. (OPTIONAL) Override the _verifyAttestationsDeletionRequest so it no longer throws
 * 3. (OPTIONAL) Override _beforeDeleteAttestations and _afterDeleteAttestations hooks

 * For more information: https://attesters.docs.sismo.io
